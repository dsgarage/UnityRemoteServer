    private static HttpListener _listener;
    
    // Properties use PascalCase
    public static bool IsRunning { get; private set; }
    
    // Methods use PascalCase
    public static void StartServer()
    {
        // Use meaningful variable names
        var configuration = LoadConfiguration();
        
        // Always use braces, even for single lines
        if (configuration != null)
        {
            ApplyConfiguration(configuration);
        }
    }
}
```
