## What is Unity Remote Server?

Unity Remote Server is a lightweight HTTP server that runs inside Unity Editor, providing REST APIs for remote control and automation. It enables:

- **Automated Testing** - Run tests without manual Unity interaction
- **CI/CD Integration** - Build projects from command line or scripts
- **Remote Development** - Control Unity from external tools
- **Monitoring** - Track compilation status and errors in real-time

## Key Features

### üöÄ Zero Configuration
The server starts automatically when Unity Editor launches. No setup required!

### üîí Security First
Only binds to localhost (127.0.0.1) by default, preventing external access.

### üßµ Thread-Safe
Properly handles Unity's main thread requirements for safe API calls.

### üìù Extensible
Easy to add custom endpoints for your specific needs.
